Implementation of BCD for DNNs in *Global Convergence of Block Coordinate Descent in Deep Learning* [(Zeng et al., ICML 2019)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/zeng19a.html) in PyTorch (See also [T. T.-K. Lau et al. (ICLR 2018 Workshop)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HycIjFkPM)) with the MNIST dataset.
